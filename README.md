EHCH contracts with silicon valley tech corps to leverage ai technology
Upgrade the existing ETH smart contract
To create the world's first decentralized commercial application of artificial intelligence
An unmanned intelligent contract project without the influence of individuals, organizations and institutions
ESCH contract alliances emerged
Committed to build a fair, fair, open and transparent investment environment for all players involved in the consensus.
This is a perfect decentralized technology application based on ETH common chain.
More importantly, it is a commercial financial system with infinite circulation block chain contract.
ESCH contract alliance builds a brand new block chain ecological financial system!
Decentralized network and artificial intelligence constitute the core technologies of ESCH and guarantee its security.
The smart contract technology is open source on github and ETH, and the code is fully deployed on the smart contract
All data links are stored, all instructions are executed through the chain,
Players can use any decentralized wallet operation
Participation requires no identity information, as long as there is a decentralized Ethernet wallet address
All assets are automatically managed by the contract, and the contract automatically distributes the benefits only when the contract conditions are reached and triggered.
No human manipulation, no human control,
All statistics, accounting, distribution and payment are performed automatically by ai and contract.
The absolute security of the three core sectors of information, technology and assets is truly realized without manual operation.
 
ESCH USES the ETH public chain's distributed storage to build the data base of the entire business,
The smart contract replaces the original commercial settlement unit
Realize automatic distribution system based on network protocol,
The statistics, accounting, distribution and payment in the business sector are all completed in the chain.
Build a sustainable circular financial system with fair, fair, open and transparent data.
ESCH applies cross-generational smart contracts and artificial intelligence technologies to the economic cycle,
Bring technology and finance together
A new intelligent financial management system has been born.
Eventually it will reshape the way the economy works,
Improve the efficiency of the entire economic cycle, greatly improve the frequency of financial transactions.
Allow players participating in ESCH to enjoy the value of financial equity.
This is a technological leap across time
